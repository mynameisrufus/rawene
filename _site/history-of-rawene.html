                    <h2>Rawene Timeline 1800-1900</h2>
                    <p class="lead">
                    Rawene started as a timber centre, with a mill and
                    shipyards established in the early 19th century.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    1819: Samuel Marsden journeys to Hokianga, down the  Utakura River to MoMM
                    Island near Kohukohu, then on to  Whiria at Pakanae, out to
                    the heads, then to Whirinaki,  and  on  to  Rawene  (which
                    Marsden  refers  to  as  Wetewhahetee, and names its chief
                    as Tarawheka).  A  party  of  50  then  sets  off  up  the
                    Waima  River  (then  known as the Punakitere). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    1820: Marsden joins a party sent by Captain Skinner, of  the
                    Dromedary,  tracing  his  earlier route. A member of the 
                    party reports “a very  large Pah  on a point of land which
                    juted  out into the river forming one 
                    of  the   Heads   to   the   entrance”.  This Pah is
                    generally believed to  be  Tahere,  on  the  hill  above
                    where the Hospital now stands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Early  1800s:  Timber  Mill  and  Shipyards established in
                    Hokianga.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    1822:  Captain  Herd  visits   Hokianga   on   the
                    Providence,  the  first  trading  ship  to  enter  the
                    Harbour,  and  loads  spars and masts. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    1826: Herd returns with the Rosanna  and another vessel,
                    Lambton,  commanded  by  Captain  BarneW,  bringing  sawyers
                    and  tradesmen  with  the  intenMon  of  seWling  them  in
                    Hokianga.  The  voyage  is  funded  by  E.  G.  Wakefield
                    via a company that was the precursor of the  New Zealand
                    Company.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    1827:  On  26  January  Herd  purchases  Rawene  from
                    Muriwai,  an  influenMal  chief  from  Utakura,  for  the
                    Wakefield  Company.  Herd  returns  to  Sydney  on  11
                    February acer being warned that an aWempt was to be  made to
                    seize his ship. One seWler remains, and three  others later
                    join him. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    End of 1830s: Most land sales are upriver of Rawene,  and
                    comparatively small areas  of land have passed out of  Maori
                    hands  below  Rawene.  Most  of  the  200  or  so  European
                    seWlers in Hokianga are also based upstream  of Rawene.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    1837-1838:  William  White,  an  “unfrocked”  Wesleyan
                    missionary, has a house built for him at Rawene while he  is
                    on a visit to England.  It seems he never lived in this
                    house himself. At this Mme Rawene “had failed to aWract
                    Europeans”. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    1839: William Wakefield inspects the land purchased by  Herd
                    and  decides  it  is  not  suitable  for  NZ  Company
                    purposes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    1840s:  No  claim  of  ownership  of  the  Rawene  land
                    purchased by Herd is lodged with the Old Land Claims
                    Commissioners.  Mohi  Tawhai,  Arama  Karaka  Pi
                    (Mahurehure  chiefs)  and  Papahurihia  (Omanaia)  have
                    previously  claimed  an  interest  in  the  land,  but  do
                    not  dispute Muriwai’s interest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    1841-1843:: McDonough (or McDonogh) in possession of  White’s
                    house  and  acting  as  Resident  Magistrate  and
                    Postmaster.  Later  appointees  are based in other places.
                    There  is   no  record  of  “subsequent  funcMonaries”
                    having  lived   in 
                    Rawene until about 1861.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Late   1840s:  Rawene   apparently  has  no  permanent
                    European  inhabitants,  and  the  focus  of  social and
                    commercial activity is  small  in  the  upper  harbour. 
                    Downstream  from  Rawene  European  commercial  and  social
                    activity remain minimal. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    1850s: Government iniMates acMon to lay out a township  on
                    Herd’s  Point.  Tawhai,  Pi,  Papahurihia  and  others
                    assert  their  rights  to  different  areas  within  the
                    settlement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    1851:  MortoniJones  (an  officer  on  the  survey  ship
                    Pandora  which  charted  the  Harbour  in  1851)  reports
                    that  only  “two  or  three  sawyers  with  very  ruinous
                    residences at present hold quiet possession” in Rawene.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    1858: Ownership of Rawene “resolved” when the Crown  decides
                    that Maori title had been extinguished by Herd’s  deed.
                    Tawhai  and  Pi  reluctantly  accept  (Land  Commissioner)
                    Bell’s offer of three acres each. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    1859:  William  Clarke  surveys  occupaMons  of  Rawene
                    land, showing  occupations by Mohi Tawhai and Arama  Karaka
                    Pi ‘on the Point’. Papahurihia is in possession of  a  small
                    setllement on the south side of the peninsula, at  Te Raupo.
                    It is generally acknowledged at the time that  the  Rawene
                    district  comes  within  Mahurehure  tribal  territory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    1861: Sir George Grey convenes meeting of 1500 Maori  at
                    Rawene. Decision to locate a Resident Magistrate in  Rawene. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    1862: J. R. Clendon appointed resident magistrate. There  is
                    neither a home for his family nor a courthouse from  which
                    to operate. At Rawene only a few squaWers are  present, one
                    of who is Bryers, with whom the Clendons  apparently live
                    for a time.
